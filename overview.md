PUBG Red Zone is a web application created by IBM developer advocates. It features an always-exciting video stream of a player, somewhere in the world, playing the extremely popular computer game Player Unknown's Battlegrounds.

On twitch.tv and other websites, professional and semi profession computer players stream a live feed of their play. Hundreds and sometimes even thousands of people tune in to these streams live. At any given time thousands of people are streaming on twitch.tv and hundreds of thousands of viewers are watching their streams.

Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is a brand new, still in beta, unfinished, video game sensation. It is the game of the summer, if not the game of the year. Everyone is streaming it and tuning in to streams playing it. The problem is that part of this game is relatively boring.

The game is a first person or third person shooter game. 100 players spawn on an island, searching for loot and killing each other. No respawns. Only one player can win. Think hunger games meets call of duty.

Watching a steamer when they are close to winning (25 people or less alive) is very exciting. But watching a streamer when there are 90 or 80 or even 50 people alive is much less exciting.

PUBG Red Zone watches all the streams available on twitch.tv and switches between streams, showing the streams that are the most exciting. This webpage can be left on a second monitor, or on at TV in a lobby or sports bar.

Using computers to watch the entire streaming space for a game is a new thing only PUBG Red Zone does right now. Using algorithms to switch between the streams like a "virtual director" is another innovative step.

This application is written in Node.js, deployed on IBM Bluemix Container Service (Kubernetes), and uses computer vision (tesseract-ocr) to derive meaning from a twitch stream.
