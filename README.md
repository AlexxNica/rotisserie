pubgredzone takes the concept of the [red zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(gridiron_football))
in American football and applies it to the popular online battle royale game
[PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS](https://www.playbattlegrounds.com/main.pu). The
idea is to always be viewing the most popular PUBG twitch stream with the least
amount of people alive in-game. This way,  your PUBG viewing experience is
always kept as spicy as possible!
